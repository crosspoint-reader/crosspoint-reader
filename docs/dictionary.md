# Dictionary

Look up words and phrases while reading an EPUB using an offline StarDict dictionary stored on the SD card.

## Supported Format

The reader supports **StarDict** dictionaries. When searching for dictionaries online, look for "StarDict format" or files with `.dict`, `.idx`, and `.ifo` extensions.

A dictionary folder must contain:

- `.idx` — word index (required, **must be uncompressed** — a `.idx.gz` will not work; decompress it on your computer with `gzip -d` first)
- `.dict` or `.dict.dz` — definition data (`.dict.dz` is supported as-is; entries are decompressed on the fly during lookup)
- `.syn` — synonym index (optional; maps alternate spellings and irregular forms to their headword)
- `.ifo` — metadata (optional)

Not supported: dictionaries with 64-bit index offsets (`idxoffsetbits=64` in the `.ifo` — rare, and rejected with an error).

> [!NOTE]  
> If you use .dict.dz and Crosspoint failed to load your dictionary with error message "Not enough memory", try unzipping it.

## Setting Up a Dictionary

1. Copy your dictionary folder(s) to `/dictionaries/` on the SD card — one dictionary per folder, e.g. `/dictionaries/webster/webster.idx` + `webster.dict.dz`. A hidden `/.dictionaries/` folder (dot-prefixed) works the same way, for keeping it out of the file browser.
2. Open **Settings → Reader → Dictionary** on the device.
3. Select a dictionary from the list, or **None** to disable lookups.

The Dictionary setting only appears when at least one usable dictionary folder exists. Folders containing more than one dictionary (multiple `.idx` stems) are skipped as ambiguous.

## Looking Up Words and Phrases

Two ways to start a lookup while reading:

- Open the reader menu (**Confirm**) and choose **Look Up**.
- Or set **Settings → Controls → Long-press Menu** to "Dictionary", then hold **Confirm** (~0.4s) on the reading page.

### Selecting Text

**On button-driven devices:**

1. A selection cursor appears on a word. Use **Left/Right** to navigate between words in reading order, and the side **Up/Down** buttons to jump between lines or flip across nearby pages.
2. Press **Confirm** (**Select**) to anchor the start of the selection.
3. **Single word:** Press **Confirm** again immediately (**Look Up**) to look up the highlighted word.
4. **Phrase / multiple words:** Use **Left/Right** or **Up/Down** to extend the highlighted selection across words, lines, or pages. Then press **Confirm** (**Look Up**).
5. Press **Back** at any time to cancel and return to reading.

**On touchscreen devices:**

- Tap or drag the selection handles across words to highlight a word or phrase, then tap **Look Up**.

On the very first lookup with a dictionary (and again whenever the `.idx` or `.syn` source file changes), the reader shows *"Indexing dictionary…"* while it builds small sidecar files next to them — a `.qidx` for the word index, and a `.sidx` when a `.syn` synonym file is present. Each sidecar is rebuilt independently, only when its own source changes. This takes a few seconds for large dictionaries and makes all subsequent lookups fast. The sidecars can be deleted safely at any time — they will simply be rebuilt.

### How Lookup Works

1. **Direct match** — the word or phrase is searched as-is (case-insensitive) in the dictionary index. Leading and trailing punctuation and whitespace are stripped automatically. Multi-word phrases match dictionary entries containing spaces (such as idioms, phrasal verbs, or compound terms). An index may list the same headword more than once (one entry per part of speech, for example); every entry it lists is shown, each labelled with its headword.
2. **Synonyms** — on a miss, if the dictionary ships a `.syn` file, alternate spellings and irregular forms recorded there are resolved to their headword (e.g. `oxen` → `ox`, `colour` → `color`). All the headwords a synonym points at are shown. This step is skipped if the `.sidx` sidecar could not be built (e.g. transient low memory during indexing); the dictionary otherwise stays usable, and the build is retried the next time it is opened.
3. **Stemming** — still no match: common English word forms are retried automatically: possessives and plurals (`dogs` → `dog`, `stories` → `story`) and verb endings (`walked` → `walk`, `running` → `run`, `making` → `make`).
4. **Not found** — a short popup appears and you return to word selection.

## The Definition Screen

When a word is found, the definition screen shows the matched headword at the top and the definition text below, with a page counter for long definitions. A word that maps to several definitions shows all of them one after another, each labelled with its headword; if they do not all fit, the ones that fit are shown. If the first definition fills the size limit, it is shown alone without an extra label.

HTML dictionaries (`sametypesequence=h`) and XDXF dictionaries (`sametypesequence=x`) use the EPUB text-layout engine for supported formatting such as headings, bold, italics, lists, and line breaks. Unrecognized tags keep their text without special formatting. Images and CSS styling are ignored. Definitions that are too large or cannot be parsed or laid out within the available memory fall back to plain text.

Definitions are drawn in your reading font. Dictionaries may use IPA symbols (e.g. `ˈ ː ɹ ɪ ʊ`…) as pronunciation guide, which built-in reader fonts do not include, so they are shown as `�`. To see them, install an [SD card font](./sd-card-fonts.md) that covers IPA and select it as the reading font.

- **Left/Right** or side **Up/Down** — previous / next page
- **Confirm** — select words or a phrase inside the definition, then choose **Look Up**
- **Long press on text** — select the touched word on touchscreen devices when touch reader controls are enabled
- **Back during selection** — cancel selection
- **Back while reading a definition** — return to the previous definition, or to book word selection at the first definition
- **Long Back while reading a definition** — hold **Back** for at least one second, then release to close all definitions and return directly to reading
- **Long press the header Back arrow** — close all definitions and return directly to reading on touchscreen devices, even when touch reader controls are disabled

During definition word selection, press **Back** to cancel selection first, then hold **Back** or long-press the header Back arrow to leave the lookup chain.

Nested lookups use the same dictionary. Both formatted and plain-text definitions support selection.
Returning to a previous definition restores its page and remembers its selection for the next press of **Confirm**.

The reader keeps up to 16 previous definitions. At this limit, another lookup shows a brief message and leaves the current definition open.
A failed lookup reloads the current definition and keeps its page and selection.

The current definition is released before loading another entry, so two definitions do not need to fit in memory together.
Returning to a previous definition reads it from the SD card again.
If a previous definition cannot be read or its position restored, the definition screen closes and returns to book word selection.
The screen also closes if a failed forward lookup cannot reload the current definition.
