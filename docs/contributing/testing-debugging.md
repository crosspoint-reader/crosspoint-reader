# Testing and Debugging

CrossPoint runs on real hardware, so debugging usually combines local build checks and on-device logs.

## Local checks

Make sure `clang-format` 21+ is installed and available in `PATH` before running the formatting step.
If needed, see [Getting Started](./getting-started.md).

```sh
./bin/clang-format-fix
pio check --fail-on-defect low --fail-on-defect medium --fail-on-defect high
pio run
```

## Flash and monitor

Flash firmware:

```sh
pio run --target upload
```

Open serial monitor:

```sh
pio device monitor
```

Optional enhanced monitor:

```sh
python3 -m pip install pyserial colorama matplotlib
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py
```

## Heap investigations

The `[MEM]` log line reports free heap and the largest free block every 10
seconds. To find which allocations cause a drop, or which ones split the heap so
that a large allocation fails, build the `heaptrace` environment. See
[Heap allocation tracing](../heap-trace.md).

## Useful bug report contents

- Firmware version and build environment
- Exact steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Serial logs from boot through failure
- Whether issue reproduces after clearing `.crosspoint/` cache on SD card
