// Writes `len` bytes of reader progress to `<cachePath>/progress.bin` without
// ever leaving the canonical file half-written.
//
// The bytes go to a temporary `progress.bin.tmp` first; only once that is fully
// written and closed is it renamed over progress.bin. An interrupted write
// (power loss or a crash mid-SPI) therefore damages only the throwaway temp file.
// Previously a truncate-in-place write that was cut short left progress.bin with
// a broken FAT cluster chain that the firmware could neither rewrite nor clear,
// stranding the book on an old page (issue #2275).
//
// This is crash-safe, not metadata-atomic: on FAT the replace is remove + rename,
// two separate directory operations, so a crash between them can leave neither
// file -- which simply reads as "no saved progress" on next launch, never a
// corrupt or unclearable file. The point is that progress.bin is never torn.
//
// Note: this prevents corruption on a healthy card going forward. It cannot
// repair an already-corrupted progress.bin -- removing the stale file may itself
// fail at the FAT level, in which case recovery still requires fsck on a host.
//
// Returns true only if the new progress.bin is fully in place.
