## Git Workflow and Repository Awareness

### Repository Detection Protocol

**CRITICAL**: ALWAYS verify repository context before git operations. This could be:

- A **fork** with `origin` pointing to personal repo, `upstream` to main repo
- A **direct clone** with `origin` pointing to main repo
- Multiple collaborator remotes

**Verification Commands** (run at session start):

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# Check all remotes
git remote -v

# Check working tree status
git status --short
```

**Example Output** (forked repository):

```text
origin      https://github.com/<your-username>/crosspoint-reader.git (fetch/push)
upstream    https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader.git (fetch/push)
```

### Git Operation Rules

1. Integration branches and PR comparisons target `develop`, not `master` or the remote's symbolic HEAD.
2. Push only when the human explicitly instructs you to push. Approval to edit or commit does not authorize a push. Never open or close a PR; the human owns those actions.
3. Before an explicitly requested push, inspect remotes again and use `fork` for the feature branch unless the human specifies otherwise.
4. Never add Claude, Codex, or assistant self-attribution as a commit co-author or generated-by trailer.
5. When a change supersedes or adapts another person's PR, verify the original human author from Git/GitHub and add that person as `Co-Authored-By`; skip bot authors.

### Branch Naming Convention

**For feature/fix branches**:

```text
feature/<short-description>       # New features
fix/<issue-number>-<description>  # Bug fixes
refactor/<component-name>         # Code refactoring
docs/<topic>                      # Documentation updates
```

**Examples**:

- `feature/sd-download-progress`
- `fix/123-orientation-crash`
- `refactor/hal-storage`

### Commit Message Format

**Pattern**:

```text
<type>: <short summary (50 chars max)>

<optional detailed description>
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`

**Example**:

```text
feat: add real-time SD download progress bar

Implements progress tracking for book downloads using
UITheme progress bar component with heap-safe updates.

Tested in all 4 orientations with 5MB+ files.
```

### When to Commit

**A local commit may be made when**:

- User explicitly requests: "commit these changes"
- Feature or bug fix is complete and the human has approved the local commit
- Refactoring preserves all functionality
- All tests pass (`pio run` succeeds)

**DO NOT commit when**:

- Build fails or has warnings
- Experimenting or debugging in progress
- User hasn't explicitly requested commit
- Files excluded by `.gitignore` would be included — always run `git status` and cross-check against `.gitignore` before staging (e.g., `*.generated.h`, `.pio/`, `compile_commands.json`, `platformio.local.ini`)

**Rule**: **If uncertain, ASK before committing.**

Hardware testing is required before a PR is opened, not before an explicitly
approved local commit. The agent gives the human a concrete device test plan
and never claims the hardware result itself.
